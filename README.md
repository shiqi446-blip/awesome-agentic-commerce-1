## What is Agentic Commerce?

Agentic commerce is the emerging paradigm where AI agents act on behalf of users to discover products, compare options, and complete purchases. Instead of humans clicking "buy" buttons on websites, AI assistants like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot can browse catalogs, compare prices, and execute transactions autonomously.

**The Challenge:** Traditional e-commerce assumes a human is directly interacting with a website. When an AI agent acts on behalf of a user, new questions arise:
- How does a merchant know the agent is authorized to buy?
- How can agents from different platforms communicate?
- How do you prove the user actually wanted this purchase?

**The Solution:** A stack of complementary open protocols — commerce (UCP, ACP), payment authorization (AP2, MPP, AMP), agent communication (A2A), and the transport and tool layer beneath them (MCP, WebMCP) — plus a shared agent-identity layer ([Web Bot Auth](#web-bot-auth)). No single protocol covers the whole journey, and most real deployments combine several.

## Standards Bodies & Governance

> Where each protocol actually lives, as of September 2026

Through 2026 the major agentic protocols moved out of single-vendor stewardship and into neutral foundations. Knowing which body owns which spec matters more than it used to — it determines who can change the protocol and how fast.

| Body | Hosts | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)** — Linux Foundation | MCP, A2A, goose, AGENTS.md | Formed December 9, 2025. Platinum members: AWS, Anthropic, Block, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI. Runs an **Agentic Commerce working group**. |
| **x402 Foundation** — Linux Foundation | x402 | Announced April 2, 2026 at MCP Dev Summit NA; operational launch July 14, 2026 with 40 founding members (17 premier, incl. Visa, Stripe, Solana Foundation). |
| **FIDO Alliance** | AP2, Mastercard Verifiable Intent | Agentic Authentication TWG (CVS Health, Google, OpenAI) + Payments TWG (Mastercard, Visa), formed April 2026. |
| **UCP Governing Council** | UCP | Google, Shopify, Stripe as permanent members plus elected open seats; Technical Committee (16 seats) and per-vertical Domain Technical Councils. |
| **OpenAI + Stripe** | ACP | Still maintained directly by the two co-authors; no external foundation. |

## UCP - Universal Commerce Protocol

> End-to-end commerce standard for AI agent transactions

**Maintainers:** Google, Shopify, Stripe (Governing Council) + Etsy, Wayfair, Target, Walmart
**Latest release:** [v2026-08-25](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp/releases/tag/v2026-08-25) — multi-vertical refactor, vendor-neutral 3DS2, payment schedules
**Cadence:** quarterly releases (agreed by the Technical Council, July 2026)

### What is UCP?

UCP is "the common language for platforms, agents, and businesses." It defines building blocks for the entire commerce journey—from product discovery to checkout to order tracking—through a single, standardized interface.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Checkout** - Unified checkout sessions supporting complex cart logic, dynamic pricing, and tax calculations
- **Identity Linking** - OAuth 2.0-based secure connections between agents and user accounts (loyalty programs, saved addresses)
- **Order Management** - Real-time webhooks for shipment tracking, returns, and post-purchase updates

**Why it matters:** Without UCP, every agent platform would need custom integrations with every merchant (N×N problem). UCP collapses this into a single standard that any agent can use with any UCP-enabled merchant.

### 🆕 What Changed in v2026-08-25

The August 2026 release is the point where UCP stopped being shopping-shaped and became a general commerce protocol. It carries **breaking changes** — treat it as a migration, not a bump.

**Breaking:**
- **Payment moved out of `shopping` into `common`** — `split_payments`, `payment_terms`, and `ap2_mandates` now live under `dev.ucp.common.payment.*`
- **Spec reorganized into domain verticals**, with shared primitives under `common/types/`
- **Buyer consent restructured** from fixed booleans into a dynamic map keyed by reverse-DNS identifiers (`dev.ucp.consent.*`) returning `consent_purpose` objects
- **`signing_keys[]` removed**; `keys[]` (JWK Set) is now the sole canonical signing key field
- **Fulfillment schema restructured** — `allows_` prefixes dropped, `multi_destination` remodeled from map to array, `fulfillment_option.description` upgraded to a structured object
- **Fractional quantities** — `quantity` is now `anyOf` integer or a structured `measure.json` object, with sale-basis pricing steps
- **Structured request constraints** — static schemas replaced by response-carried `$requestConstraints` with JSONPath targeting

**New capabilities:**
- **Actions primitive** — a horizontal `actions[]` array for out-of-band requests such as authentication
- **Vendor-agnostic 3D Secure (3DS2)** — Device Data Collection and Challenge flows, no vendor lock-in
- **Location search & lookup** — physical store search with geocoding, plus standardized operating hours with timezone handling
- **Payment schedules** — deferred payments, deposits, installments
- **Split payments** — multi-instrument checkout
- **Capability versioning** — formal date-based versioning and forward-compatibility guidelines

### 🏛️ Governance & Domain Councils

UCP expanded from a single spec into a multi-vertical program with dedicated councils:

| Council | Formed | Inaugural Members |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| **Food** | July 16, 2026 | Block (Square), DoorDash, Google, Toast, Uber Eats |
| **Lodging** | August 11, 2026 | Amadeus, Booking.com, Expedia, Google, Hilton, Marriott, Trip.com |
| **Payments** | September 2, 2026 | Adyen, Ant International, Coinbase, Global Payments, Google, PayPal, Shopify, Stripe |

- **Governing Council** — Stripe joined as a permanent member (April 28, 2026) alongside Google and Shopify, plus two elected open seats
- **Technical Committee** — expanded to 16 seats, adding Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Stripe

- [UCP Announcements](https://ucp.dev/documentation/announcements/) - Council formations and release notices

### 📊 Adoption Signal

Independent crawler data from [UCP Checker](https://ucpchecker.com/blog/state-of-agentic-commerce-august-2026) (August 2026) — useful directionally, but read the caveats:

- **15,735 verified storefronts**, up from 5,294 in May 2026 (+197%)
- **99.82% of the fleet** converged on a single spec revision within a day of release
- **MCP is the dominant transport**, reaching essentially the entire verified fleet
- ⚠️ **Adoption is platform-driven, not merchant-driven.** Wix's arrival alone contributed ~5,198 stores (roughly a third of the fleet), and observed capabilities show near-zero deviation from platform templates
- ⚠️ **Activation lags adoption.** Only 4 stores declared payment tokens (none production-ready); of 27 declaring identity linking, ~67% left it unconfigured

The practical read: the spec is no longer the blocker at the median store — deployment and activation are.

## ACP - Agentic Commerce Protocol

> Open standard for programmatic commerce between AI agents and businesses

**Maintainers:** OpenAI, Stripe (originally co-created with Meta)
**Latest stable version:** `2026-04-17` (cart, feed, orders, authentication, MCP compatibility) — unchanged as of September 2026; active work sits in the repo's `unreleased/` directory
**Status:** Beta, Apache 2.0, date-based versioning

### What is ACP?

ACP enables AI agents to complete purchases on behalf of users directly within chat interfaces—like buying products without leaving a ChatGPT conversation. It powers features like "Instant Checkout" where users can discover and purchase items seamlessly.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Shared Payment Token (SPT)** - A secure, one-time-use token that lets agents initiate payments without ever seeing the user's card number. The token is scoped to a specific merchant and cart total.
- **Agentic Checkout** - A RESTful API (or MCP server) that merchants implement with four endpoints: create, update, complete, and cancel checkout
- **Delegated Payment** - The flow where Stripe (or another PSP) issues an SPT, and the agent passes it to the merchant to complete the transaction

**Why it matters:** ACP separates payment credentials from the agent entirely. The user pays through Stripe's secure interface, receives an SPT, and the agent never touches sensitive payment data—solving the PCI compliance challenge for AI commerce.

### 📌 Current Status (September 2026)

ACP has been quiet since April 2026 while UCP shipped two releases. Worth understanding the shape of where it landed:

- **No new spec since `2026-04-17`.** Released versions are `2025-09-29`, `2025-12-12`, `2026-01-16`, `2026-01-30`, `2026-04-17`. New work is staged in `unreleased/`.
- **The protocol outlived its flagship product.** OpenAI retired Instant Checkout in March 2026 after roughly five months of near-zero sales, repositioning ACP toward product discovery and merchant feeds, with checkout handed back to the merchant side and dedicated retailer apps (Walmart, Target, Instacart) inside ChatGPT.
- **Meta is a significant ACP surface.** Facebook's native "Buy now" checkout is Stripe-powered over ACP, with Instagram ads slated to follow.
- ⚠️ **Naming collision to watch:** the widely-cited "2026-07-28" release is the **MCP** specification, *not* ACP. Several secondary sources conflate the two.

## AP2 - Agent Payments Protocol

> Secure payment authorization for agent-led transactions using cryptographic mandates

**Maintainers:** FIDO Alliance (donated by Google, April 2026)
**Partners:** 60+ at launch (September 2025), passing 100 by late October 2025
**Latest version:** v0.2.0, released April 28, 2026 (introduces "Human Not Present" autonomous payments) — still current as of September 2026; no v0.3
**Standardization:** Now progressing through the FIDO Agentic Authentication TWG and Payments TWG rather than as standalone releases
**Roadmap:** Digital wallets, push payment methods (UPI, PIX), digital currencies

### What is AP2?

AP2 solves a fundamental problem: **How do you prove a user actually authorized an agent to make a purchase?** Today's payment systems assume a human is clicking "buy." When an autonomous agent makes a purchase—especially when the user isn't present—there's no proof of intent.

AP2 introduces **Mandates**: tamper-proof, cryptographically-signed digital contracts that serve as verifiable evidence of user authorization.

> ⚠️ **Terminology change (2026):** what earlier documentation called the **Cart Mandate** is now the **Checkout Mandate**. The spec site was reorganized under `/ap2/*` paths and older `/topics/*` and `/specification/` URLs no longer resolve. Material written before mid-2026 — including most tutorials — still uses the old names.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Checkout Mandate** *(formerly Cart Mandate)* - Authorizes completion of a specific checkout. The Shopping Agent composes the content, a Trusted Surface displays it to the user, and the Merchant verifies and signs the enclosed Checkout object. This is the non-repudiable proof of intent.
- **Payment Mandate** - Conveyed separately to credential providers and merchants, and potentially shared with networks and issuers. Signals that an agent is involved, enabling appropriate risk assessment and dispute resolution.
- **Intent Mandate** - Pre-authorization for future purchases with constraints. Example: "Buy concert tickets under $100 when they go on sale." The agent can act autonomously within these bounds.
- **Agent Authorization Framework** - A distinct specification section covering how an agent's authority is established and verified.

**Roles:** Shopping Agent (discovery, checkout construction, execution) · Credential Provider (sources credentials, verifies agent authorization) · Merchant (catalog, fulfillment) · Merchant Payment Processor · **Trusted Surface** (the UI that obtains user consent before a mandate is created) · Network and Issuer.

**Positioning:** AP2 now describes itself as an extension for **A2A, MCP, and UCP** — the explicit UCP alignment is newer than the original framing.

**Why it matters:** When disputes arise ("I didn't authorize this!"), AP2 mandates provide cryptographic proof of exactly what the user approved. This protects merchants, payment providers, and users in the new world of autonomous agent purchases.

## MPP - Machine Payments Protocol

> Open standard for autonomous agent micropayments

**Co-Authors:** Stripe, Tempo
**Launched:** March 18, 2026, alongside Tempo mainnet
**Spec home:** [mpp.dev](https://mpp.dev)

### What is MPP?

MPP is an open, HTTP-native standard for autonomous agent micropayments. A server answers an unpaid request with HTTP `402` and payment requirements; the agent authorizes, retries, and receives the resource plus a receipt. It introduces a **sessions primitive** that allows AI agents to initiate, manage, and settle small-value transactions without human intervention at each step.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Sessions** - A primitive that bundles multiple micropayments into a single authorized context, reducing friction for high-frequency agent transactions
- **Streaming payments** - Added as a first-class primitive at Stripe Sessions 2026 (April 29–30). Bills per-token, per-second, or per-call usage in real time against a stablecoin balance
- **Micropayments** - Designed for small-value, high-volume payments typical of agent-to-agent and agent-to-service interactions
- **Multi-Rail Support** - Cards via Shared Payment Tokens (min 0.50 USD), stablecoins via Tempo (min 0.01 USDC), plus Visa card rails and Bitcoin Lightning through Lightspark

**Relationship to x402:** MPP shares a signature substrate with x402 (EIP-3009 and Permit2 for off-chain authorization) but adds the lifecycle machinery — subscriptions, streaming usage, cancellation, and reconciliation — that raw HTTP 402 leaves out.

**Why it matters:** As AI agents consume paid APIs, purchase digital goods, and transact with other agents autonomously, traditional checkout flows break down. MPP provides a purpose-built payment layer for machine-to-machine commerce at scale.

### What is AMP?

AMP is the first agentic payment protocol designed natively for mobile interfaces — smartphones, smartwatches, AR glasses, and in-car systems — rather than card-based desktop checkout. It establishes a universal, auditable standard for AI agents to transact across digital wallets and super apps.

**Key Concepts:**
- **KYA (Know Your Agent) Framework** - Establishes an agent's digital identity and certifies its authorized capabilities, parallel to KYC for humans
- **Agent Trust Rating** - Dynamic risk-management score that determines an agent's trustworthiness and controls its level of autonomy
- **Money-back Guarantee** - Every agent-initiated transaction is backed by a refund mechanism for payment partners in cases of account takeover
- **Cross-device Compatibility** - Designed for non-card form factors absent from traditional payment rails

**Why it matters:** The Alipay+ network reaches 1.8B user accounts and 150M merchants globally — primarily across APAC. AMP gives this footprint an agentic-commerce layer and complements card-based protocols (Visa TAP, Mastercard Agent Pay) for emerging markets where mobile wallets dominate.

### 🚀 Phase I Rollout (September 2026)

AMP moved from announcement to production in September 2026:

- **10 Alipay+ digital wallets** live, together serving ~1.5B user accounts
- **7 acquiring partners**: Adyen, Allinpay, Checkout.com, Fiserv, Global Payments, Nuvei, Worldline
- Ant International also joined the **UCP Payments Technical Council** (September 2, 2026) and the **KYA interoperability collaboration** with Mastercard and Visa — see [Cross-Network Interoperability](#-cross-network-interoperability-kya)

## A2A - Agent2Agent Protocol

> Open standard for AI agent interoperability and communication

**Maintainers:** Agentic AI Foundation (Linux Foundation) — Growth Stage project since August 27, 2026; originally created by Google
**Latest version:** v1.0.1 (May 28, 2026); v1.0.0 on March 12, 2026 was the first stable, production-ready release
**Backing:** 150+ organizations; adopted across Google Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure

### What is A2A?

A2A enables AI agents built on different frameworks, by different companies, running on separate servers to discover each other's capabilities and collaborate on tasks—**as agents, not just as tools.**

Think of it as the "common language" that lets a travel planning agent talk to a flight booking agent, a hotel agent, and a car rental agent to coordinate a complete trip.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Agent Card** - A JSON document that agents publish describing who they are, what they can do, and how to communicate with them. It's like a business card for AI agents.
- **Tasks** - The fundamental unit of work. Tasks have a lifecycle (submitted → working → completed/failed) and can be long-running with progress updates.
- **Messages & Parts** - Agents communicate through messages containing different content types: text, files, or structured data.
- **Update Mechanisms** - Three ways to get task updates: polling (simple), streaming (real-time), or push notifications (webhooks for async work).

**A2A vs MCP:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) connects agents to **tools and data**. A2A connects **agents to other agents**. They're complementary—an agent might use MCP to access a database and A2A to delegate work to a specialized agent. As of August 2026 both are hosted by the same body, the [Agentic AI Foundation](#standards-bodies--governance).

### 🆕 v1.0 and the Move to AAIF

- **v1.0 shipped March 12, 2026** — the first stable, production-ready specification. Headline additions: multi-protocol bindings and version negotiation, multi-tenancy, **signed Agent Cards** for cryptographic identity verification, proper OAuth flows for headless agents, and paginated task listing.
- **Joined the Agentic AI Foundation on August 27, 2026** as a Growth Stage project, placing A2A under the same neutral governance as MCP rather than direct Google stewardship.
- Framework support spans LangGraph, CrewAI, Pydantic AI, AG2, and IBM BeeAI; enterprise adopters include ServiceNow, Salesforce, Atlassian, and SAP.

## MCP - Model Context Protocol

> Agent-to-tool communication — and, in practice, the dominant transport for agentic commerce

**Maintainers:** Agentic AI Foundation (Linux Foundation), donated by Anthropic December 2025
**Latest version:** `2026-07-28` — the largest revision since launch

### Why MCP belongs in an agentic commerce list

MCP started as a tool-access standard, but it has become load-bearing commerce infrastructure. UCP's dominant transport is MCP — reaching essentially the entire verified storefront fleet — ACP ships MCP compatibility as of its `2026-04-17` release, and Shopify's public agentic endpoint is an MCP server. If you are implementing UCP or ACP, you are implementing MCP.

### 🆕 What Changed in `2026-07-28`

- **Stateless core** — MCP moved from a bidirectional stateful protocol to a request/response model, so servers deploy on serverless and edge infrastructure. This directly affects how you model long-lived checkout sessions.
- **Extensions framework** — a versioned mechanism for adding capabilities without changing the core protocol
- **Tasks extension** — contributed by AWS, adds reliable long-running agent work
- **MCP Apps extension** — interactive UI surfaces
- **Authorization hardening** — the core authorization spec now tracks production OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect deployments more closely
- **Formal deprecation policy**

## WebMCP - Browser-Native Agent Tools

> Websites expose tools directly to AI agents from the page, via `document.modelContext`

**Venue:** W3C Web Machine Learning Community Group (incubation — **not** a W3C Standard or on the Standards Track)
**Authors:** Google and Microsoft engineers
**API surface:** `document.modelContext`
**Spec:** [webmachinelearning.github.io/webmcp](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webmcp)
**Vendor positions:** Mozilla **neutral**; WebKit/Safari **oppose** — see [Vendor Positions](#-vendor-positions-authoritative) before building on this

### What is WebMCP?

WebMCP lets a web page register tools that an AI agent running in the browser can call directly, rather than the agent scraping the DOM or driving a headless browser. For commerce, that means a merchant can expose "search catalog," "add to cart," or "apply discount" as first-class agent-callable tools on their existing storefront — no separate server-side MCP deployment required.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Tool registration** — pages register tools via the page-level model context API
- **Declarative form annotations** — existing forms can be surfaced to agents with markup rather than script
- **Human-in-the-loop** — tools can require explicit user interaction before executing, which matters for anything that spends money
- **Browser session auth** — tools run in the user's already-authenticated session

### 🧭 Vendor Positions (authoritative)

Both other engines have now **formally closed** their standards-positions reviews. This is the single most important fact about WebMCP's outlook, and it is frequently misreported as "under evaluation":

| Engine | Position | Date |
|---|---|---|
| **Mozilla / Firefox** | **Neutral** ([standards-positions#1412](https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1412)) | August 5, 2026 |
| **WebKit / Safari** | **Oppose** ([standards-positions#670](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/670)) | June 11, 2026 |

WebKit's opposition is architectural, not incidental. The issue is labelled with concerns spanning **privacy, security, meaningful user consent, duplication, API design, internationalization, portability, use cases, and venue**. The substance of their argument:

- An agent acting for a user is **assistive technology**, and sites should not be able to detect that a user is relying on one
- If a site's actions are hard for an agent to use, that is a gap in the page's own semantics — the fix belongs in **HTML and ARIA**, the platform's shared layers, not in a parallel agent-facing tool layer
- The proposal designs a solution before establishing what the problem actually is

**Why this matters for commerce:** WebKit's "don't expose that the user is using an agent" invariant runs in the opposite direction from [Web Bot Auth](#web-bot-auth), Visa TAP, and the [KYA framework](#-cross-network-interoperability-kya), all of which exist precisely so merchants *can* identify and verify agents. That is a genuine unresolved tension in the stack, not a detail.

Discussion is ongoing and the spec authors have signalled willingness to converge — including floating a declarative-only variant — so this is not necessarily final.

### 📊 Reported Implementation Status

⚠️ **Sources conflict here — verify before relying on it.**

The spec repo's own [implementation-status.md](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webmcp/blob/main/implementation-status.md) reports Origin Trials live in **Chrome 149** and **Edge 150**, experimental support in Brave's Leo, and support in ChatGPT Desktop. Local development uses the `about:flags#enable-webmcp-testing` flag.

However, the [Chrome Platform Status entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5117755740913664) still lists WebMCP as **"Proposed"** with no origin trial flag set, and records "No signal" for Firefox and Safari — which the closed standards-positions issues above show is out of date. Treat the spec repo as a motivated source on its own adoption, and the vendor positions table as the reliable signal.

### ⚠️ Other Caveats

- **API renamed.** The tool-registration getter moved from `navigator.modelContext` to **`document.modelContext`**. Chrome 150 deprecates the old name but keeps it as an alias — tutorials published before August 2026 still use the old spelling, so check which surface any example targets.
- **Incubation only.** Per Chrome Platform Status, maturity is "Specification being incubated in a Community Group" — not a Working Group, not on the Standards Track.

## Web Bot Auth

> Cryptographic agent identity — the layer most commerce protocols quietly depend on

**Originator:** Cloudflare
**Mechanism:** HTTP Message Signatures ([RFC 9421](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421.html)) — an Ed25519 key, a `Signature-Agent` header, and a published JWKS directory
**Standards status:** IETF working group chartered October 23, 2025 (chairs David Schinazi and Rifaat Shekh-Yusef). ⚠️ **No draft adopted as of 2026** — it is shipping in production well ahead of standardization.

### Why it belongs here

Web Bot Auth answers a question none of the commerce protocols answer on their own: *is this agent who it claims to be?* Rather than IP ranges and spoofable user-agent strings, a bot proves identity per request with a cryptographic signature. It has quietly become the common substrate under several protocols in this list:

- **Visa Trusted Agent Protocol** is built on it
- **Mastercard Agent Pay** incorporates it for agent authentication
- **Shopify** began signing and authenticating agent traffic with it in May 2026 — unsigned agents get the strictest Storefront API rate-limit tier, which makes it a practical prerequisite for agentic storefronts and Hydrogen integrations
- **OpenAI** signs ChatGPT agent and agentic requests with it
- **UCP** has tracked Web Bot Auth interoperability in its release planning

If you are building an agent that touches real merchants, this is likely to affect you before any commerce protocol does.

## How They Relate

```
User → AI Agent → Web Bot Auth (cryptographic agent identity)
                → A2A (agent discovery & coordination)
                → MCP / WebMCP (tool & transport layer)
                → UCP/ACP (commerce actions)
                → AP2 (payment authorization)
                → MPP (agent micropayments)
                → Payment Rails (Stripe, Visa TAP, Mastercard, PayPal, x402, L402)
                → Merchants & Payment Networks
```

| Protocol | Layer | Purpose | Governance |
|----------|-------|---------|------------|
| **Web Bot Auth** | Identity | Agents cryptographically prove who they are, per request | IETF WG (no adopted draft yet) |
| **MCP** | Transport / Tools | Agents reach tools and data; the de facto transport for UCP and ACP | AAIF (Linux Foundation) |
| **WebMCP** | Transport / Browser | Pages expose tools to in-browser agents | W3C Community Group (incubation) |
| **A2A** | Communication | Agents discover and talk to each other | AAIF (Linux Foundation) |
| **UCP** | Commerce | End-to-end commerce across shopping, food, and lodging | UCP Governing Council |
| **ACP** | Commerce | Agent checkout and product discovery (OpenAI/Stripe ecosystem) | OpenAI + Stripe |
| **AP2** | Payments | Secure payment authorization with mandates | FIDO Alliance |
| **MPP** | Payments | Autonomous agent micropayments, sessions, and streaming | Stripe + Tempo |
| **AMP** | Payments | Mobile-first agentic payments via digital wallets (Alipay+) | Ant International |
| **x402** | Crypto Rails | HTTP 402 stablecoin payments | x402 Foundation (Linux Foundation) |
| **L402** | Crypto Rails | Lightning Network micropayments with Macaroons | Lightning Labs |
| **Visa TAP / Mastercard Verifiable Intent / PayPal Agent Ready** | Fiat Rails | Card network and wallet infrastructure for agent transactions | Respective networks; KYA interop in progress |

### Example: Planning a Trip

1. **A2A** - Your personal agent discovers a flight agent, hotel agent, and car rental agent
2. **A2A** - Agents collaborate to find options within your $700 budget
3. **AP2** - You create an Intent Mandate: "Book travel under $700 total"
4. **UCP/ACP** - Each agent executes checkout with their respective merchants
5. **AP2** - Checkout Mandates are signed for each booking, providing proof of your approval
6. **Result** - Three coordinated bookings, all cryptographically tied to your authorization

### UCP vs ACP

Both enable commerce, but target different ecosystems:
- **UCP** - Google AI surfaces (Search AI Mode, Gemini), supports identity linking, uses AP2 for payments
- **ACP** - OpenAI/ChatGPT ecosystem, uses Shared Payment Tokens via Stripe

Merchants wanting maximum reach may implement both — or sit behind an [integration layer](#integration--orchestration-layer) that speaks several protocols at once.

**Divergence through 2026:** UCP shipped two releases between April and September 2026 and expanded into food and lodging verticals, while ACP has held at `2026-04-17` and narrowed toward discovery and feeds after Instant Checkout was retired. That asymmetry is the single biggest change in the commerce layer this year — though ACP retains reach through ChatGPT and Meta surfaces that UCP does not touch.

## Crypto Payment Rails

### x402

> HTTP 402 stablecoin payments over HTTP — no API keys, accounts, or subscriptions

**Governance:** [x402 Foundation](https://x402.org/) under the Linux Foundation (originated by Coinbase and Cloudflare)
**Latest spec:** V2 — standardized payment headers, reusable session tokens, multi-chain support via CAIP

x402 leverages HTTP's `402 Payment Required` status code for instant stablecoin payments. It requires no API keys, accounts, or subscriptions—just a wallet. x402 also serves as a crypto payment rail within AP2 — see the [x402 flow samples](https://github.com/google-agentic-commerce/AP2/tree/main/code/samples) in the AP2 repository.

**Governance timeline:** Coinbase and Cloudflare announced their intent to form the foundation in September 2025. The Linux Foundation announced the x402 Foundation on **April 2, 2026** at MCP Dev Summit North America, and declared its **operational launch on July 14, 2026** with 40 founding member organizations — 17 of them premier members, including Visa, Stripe, and the Solana Foundation.

⚠️ **Adoption reality check.** Headline figures (roughly 69,000 active agents, 165M transactions, and ~$50M cumulative volume as of April 2026) sit alongside on-chain data showing only about **$28,000 in genuine daily volume**, much of it testing or incentive-gamed activity. The infrastructure and backing are real; organic demand is not yet.

## Fiat Payment Rails

### 🤝 Cross-Network Interoperability (KYA)

> Ant International + Mastercard + Visa, September 9–10, 2026

The three networks running competing agent-identity schemes — **Visa Trusted Agent Protocol (TAP)**, **Mastercard Verifiable Intent**, and **Ant International's AMP** — began collaborating on a shared **Know-Your-Agent (KYA)** interoperability framework. This is the first serious attempt to stop agent identity fragmenting along network lines.

**What it does:** establishes shared principles so common trust signals are recognized across card networks, wallet ecosystems, agent platforms, and marketplaces, while each network keeps its own verification and decisioning. The goal is to cut duplicate agent identity verification and integration cost.

**What it is not:** a merged protocol or a published specification. As of September 2026 this is an announced collaboration on principles, not a shipped standard.

The announcement cites McKinsey's projection that AI agents could orchestrate **$3–5 trillion** of global consumer commerce by 2030.

### Visa — Intelligent Commerce

> Trusted Agent Protocol (TAP) — authentication framework for agent-to-network communication

**Initiative:** Visa "Intelligent Commerce" program
**Authentication:** [Web Bot Auth](#web-bot-auth) over HTTP Message Signatures (RFC 9421)
**Announced:** October 14, 2025 with Cloudflare and 12 launch partners (Adyen, Ant International, Checkout.com, Coinbase, CyberSource, Elavon, Fiserv, Microsoft, Nuvei, Shopify, Stripe, Worldpay)
**Status:** Commercially launched Q1 2026 — 100+ partners enrolled, 30+ in sandbox, 20+ integrating in production. Fiserv was the first major processor to adopt at scale (January 2026).

Visa's TAP provides the authentication layer for AI agents to interact with card networks directly, using cryptographic HTTP message signatures. It signs an agent's identity into HTTP request headers so a merchant can cryptographically verify that the agent is legitimate.

### Mastercard — Agent Pay

> Agentic Tokens — scoped, time-limited payment credentials for AI agents

Mastercard Agent Pay issues Agentic Tokens: scoped, time-limited credentials that allow agents to initiate payments within defined boundaries. Authentication is built on [Web Bot Auth](#web-bot-auth). Includes an official MCP server for API access. Agent Pay entered phased rollout through 2025 and is broadly available via Mastercard-certified processors in 2026.

#### Agent Pay for Machines (June 10, 2026)

A distinct product for the machine-to-machine end of the spectrum: high-velocity, low-value, and micro-transactions executed programmatically at machine speed. Four capabilities:

- **Credentialing** — every agent receives credentials; can use Verifiable Intent for cross-ecosystem recognition
- **Permissioning** — organizations set authorization rules and spending limits, programmatically enforced
- **Transacting** — verified participants connect across providers for continuous automated commerce
- **Settling** — multi-rail settlement across cards, accounts, and **stablecoins**

Notably, Mastercard states compatibility with the **x402** open standard. Backed by 30+ partners including Adyen, Stripe, Coinbase, Cloudflare, Solana Foundation, OKX, and Polygon. This puts Mastercard in direct overlap with [MPP](#mpp---machine-payments-protocol) and [x402](#x402) rather than alongside them.

### American Express — Agentic Commerce Experiences (ACE)

> Developer kit + Agent Purchase Protection — first card network with consumer-facing dispute coverage for agent errors

**Launched:** April 14, 2026
**Partners:** OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, PayPal, Stripe + 11 others

Amex ACE is a developer kit with five components: agent registration, account enablement, intent intelligence (creating an "intent contract" + Proof of Intent Token), single-use payment credentials bound to intent and constraints, and cart context (banks/brands compare submitted cart vs. intent). Pairs with **Amex Agent Purchase Protection** — industry-first coverage for charges arising from AI agent errors when both card member and merchant acted correctly.

### PayPal — Agent Ready

> ACP-based agent payments for existing PayPal and Braintree merchants

PayPal's Agent Ready enables existing merchants to accept agent-initiated payments with minimal integration overhead. PayPal manages security and PCI compliance. Includes Store Sync for catalog integration and an Agent Toolkit for programmatic access.

### Cloudflare — Agents SDK

> Infrastructure SDK with native x402 support and upcoming Visa/Mastercard agent protocol integration

Cloudflare's Agents SDK embeds payment rails directly into the edge infrastructure layer, currently supporting x402. Cloudflare is also the originator of [Web Bot Auth](#web-bot-auth), the agent-identity layer beneath both Visa TAP and Mastercard Agent Pay.

⚠️ **Status caveat:** Cloudflare announced in October 2025 that it would bring Visa TAP and Mastercard Agent Pay support "directly to the Agents SDK" over the coming months. As of the post's most recent revision (July 2026) that integration is still described as forthcoming — treat native TAP/Agent Pay support in the SDK as not yet shipped.

## Integration & Orchestration Layer

> Middleware that speaks several agentic protocols so merchants do not have to pick one

A distinct category emerged in mid-2026: rather than choosing between UCP, ACP, and AP2, enterprise merchants increasingly sit behind an abstraction layer that translates across all of them. This is a direct consequence of the protocol landscape refusing to consolidate.

### Adyen Agentic

> "The universal translator for the next era of commerce" — announced June 16, 2026

A modular API suite letting enterprises sell through conversational AI platforms without rebuilding commerce systems per channel. Three layers:

- **Agentic Feed** — distributes real-time catalog, pricing, and availability data
- **Agentic Cart** — connects existing checkout, tax, fulfillment, and order management to agent platforms
- **Agentic Payments** — authentication, token portability, and risk management for agent-led transactions

Speaks UCP, ACP, AP2, and Meta's AI checkout. Strategic partners include American Express, Mastercard, Visa, and Salesforce; early enterprise merchants include ESW, Scheels, Sezane, and SharkNinja. Limited availability for US enterprise merchants at launch.

## Market Sizing

Forecasts vary by almost an order of magnitude. Worth citing the spread rather than a single headline number.

| Source | Forecast | Scope |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **McKinsey** | **$3–5 trillion by 2030** | Global consumer commerce orchestrated by agents — the figure now cited by Visa, Mastercard, and Ant International |
| **McKinsey / ICSC** | $1 trillion by 2030 | US B2C agentic sales |
| **Bain** | $300–500 billion by 2030 | 15–25% of overall e-commerce |
| **Morgan Stanley** | $190–385 billion by 2030 | 10–20% of US online retail |

<br>

## Regulatory Landscape

> Rules are lagging the technology. Regulators are mostly publishing guidance and foresight papers rather than binding rules, which leaves liability allocation unsettled.

**The open question everywhere:** when an agent makes a purchase the user did not intend, who is liable — the agent platform, the merchant, the issuer, or the consumer? No jurisdiction answers this cleanly today. This is precisely the gap that AP2 mandates, Amex Agent Purchase Protection, and the KYA framework are each attempting to fill from the private-sector side.

### European Union
- **EU AI Act** — obligations for high-risk AI systems take full effect **August 2026**. Relevant to agents making consequential financial decisions on a user's behalf.
- [Agent Payments Protocol — EU Perspective](https://agentpaymentsprotocol.eu/) - AP2, trust, and the European regulatory frame

### United States
- **FTC** — commissioners have issued policy statements under Section 5 warning platforms against configuring agents to manipulate purchasing recommendations toward hidden commercial objectives
- **CFPB** — Regulation E is the pressure point; an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on personal financial data rights raised the question of who may act as a consumer's "representative"
- [Agentic AI Retail Regulation 2026: The FTC Guide](https://ucphub.ai/agentic-ai-retail-regulation-2026-the-ftc-guide-to-washingtons-cua-rules/) - Overview of US enforcement posture

### ⚖️ Case Law: *Amazon v. Perplexity* (Ninth Circuit, August 4, 2026)

The most consequential legal development in agentic commerce so far — it addresses whether a platform can block agents acting for its own users.

**Holding:** The Ninth Circuit **vacated** the preliminary injunction that had barred Perplexity's Comet agent from accessing Amazon.com on customers' behalf. Because traffic was routed through the *user's* computer rather than Perplexity's servers talking directly to Amazon's, the court found it was **the user who "accessed" Amazon's computers, with the help of Perplexity's agent**. "Access" under the CFAA means entering a computer system, and contemplates access by a person — not a software tool. Amazon therefore could not establish the CFAA "access" element.

**What it does *not* settle:**
- Other theories remain live — breach of contract, terms-of-service violations, and tort claims
- Agents with greater autonomy, or **direct server-to-server** communication, may land differently — the routing-through-the-user fact was load-bearing
- This was the preliminary-injunction stage only; the merits are unresolved

**Why it matters for protocol design:** the ruling's logic favors *client-side, user-routed* agents over server-side ones. That cuts across the architecture choices in this list — [WebMCP](#webmcp---browser-native-agent-tools) and browser-resident agents sit on the favorable side of that line; server-to-server commerce integrations do not necessarily.
